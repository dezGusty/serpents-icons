# serpents-icons
----------------

serpents-icons is a small repository for small, generic application icons

## Introduction
---------------
I have often found it difficult to locate icons that look good and which have a clear license.
This often leads to having to skip them, as resources with an unclear of undefined license cannot be safely considered 
for inclusion. 

The icons included here will not win any design awards, but you can use them under permissive licenses.

## Licensing
------------
The icons are provided under a dual licensing model.

You can choose under which license you with to use and redistribute the icons.
